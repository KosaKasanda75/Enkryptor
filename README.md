# Enkryptor
Encryption application for notes on your devices
It is very simple to use once you are running it:
1. Copy paste into the input section
2. Create a password according to the instructions (do not lose or forget it)
3. Voila! Your notes have now been encrypted and cannot be read by anyone

# Please Note:
When using the current version, all [return] and tabulations/indentations in your text will be lost
